# Human-Agent Interaction Prototype

This repository contains a working prototype of a Metaweb-inspired coordination layer that enables human-avatar (agent) interaction with community-aware policies, messaging, and presence tracking.

---

## üß† Project Overview

This is a full-stack prototype for interacting with digital avatars (agents) across shared communities with policy-aware actions and Proof-of-Humanity (PoH) verification.

The backend exposes APIs to:

* Log in a user avatar
* Check PoH (simulated)
* Retrieve and select communities
* Send and fetch chat messages
* Log interactions (e.g. to blockchain)
* Evaluate actions against OPA-like community rules

The frontend (WIP) is designed to:

* Trigger Canopi overlays
* Select communities
* Display avatars and chat in context

## üß± Stack

### Backend

* Node.js (Express)
* In-memory store (no DB yet)
* Simulated blockchain + policy enforcement

### Frontend (coming next)

* React + Tailwind (Canopi UI)
